        <h1 class="title">The Test baselines page</h1>
        <p>This page is very similar to the <span class="app-page">branch baselines </span>page. The difference is that this page focuses on the baselines of a single test, whereas the <span class="app-page">branch baseline</span> page shows all the baselines of all the tests on a given branch. </p>
        <p>You can reach this page from the <span class="app-page">apps and test</span> page, and prepare it for work as follows:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../common/navigate-to-test-baselines-page.flsnp" />
        <p> The main tasks you can achieve using this page are:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="page-branch-baselines/featurelist-on-baseline-pages.flsnp" />
        <p> For a detailed description of the features on this page see <MadCap:xref class="link" href="tm-page-branch-baselines.htm">The Branch baselines page</MadCap:xref>, since these pages are identical the only difference being that application and test names columns are not displayed since by definition they are all the same. </p>
        <p><span class="tbd">TBD&#160;- this needs to be a standalone page single sourced as much as possible with tm-page-branch-baslines</span>
