        <h1 class="title">The Test results page</h1>
        <p>After you run <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> visual UI tests, you use the <span class="app-page">test results</span> page  to see the outcome of the test runs, and if necessary, to update the test baselines. </p>
        <p>Using the controls and tools on this page you can you can analyze the results of the test run by filtering, sorting and grouping the information in various ways. You can look at, and compare the baseline and checkpoint images. You can <span class="app-item">accept </span>a checkpoint image so that it will become the new baseline image. Alternatively, you can <span class="app-item">reject </span>a step, indicating that the step failed, and you can assign the test to a team member for further action.</p>
        <div>
            The main tasks you can achieve on this page are:
            <ul class="bulleted-list"><li>View the overall results of the batch (did all the test pass ?). 
					See 
			 
			<MadCap:xref class="link" href="../../working-with-test-batches/understanding-the-batch-status.htm">Understanding the batch status</MadCap:xref>.</li><li>Accept or reject all the differences in a test or group of steps.</li><li>Annotate tests with issues and remarks.</li><li>Update the baseline.</li><li>Delete test results - see <MadCap:xref class="link" href="../../working-with-test-batches/how-to-delete-batches.htm">How to delete batches</MadCap:xref>. </li></ul></div>
        <div>In addition, in the views that display  a step thumbnail, you can open the test editor or step editor tools. These allow you to make side by side comparisons of the checkpoint and baseline images, and also provides the following functions:<ul class="bulleted-list"><li>Accept or reject differences in individual steps.</li><li>Annotate tests and steps with issues and remarks.</li><li>Define <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="EyesTerms.Term13">match level regions</MadCap:glossaryTerm>.</li><li>Analyze the impact of a change in match level.</li><li>Update the baseline.</li></ul></div>
        <h2 class="title">Layout</h2>
        <p>You open this page using the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="EyesTerms.Term15">page navigator</MadCap:glossaryTerm> <span class="app-item">Test result</span> menu entry.</p>
        <p><a data-lightbox="page-test-result-overview" href="../images/page-test-result-overview.png"><img class="block-image" src="../images/page-test-result-overview.png" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>The test results page is divided vertically into two panels. On the left, you can see the <span class="app-item">batch list</span> - a list of all the  <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="EyesTerms.Term7">batches</MadCap:glossaryTerm> run by your team. When you click on any entry in the batch list, it becomes the <span class="app-item">current batch</span>, and the main panel shows information on the test results of that batch. The information you can see depends on the view you select using the <span class="app-item">view selector</span> - each view focuses on a different aspect of the test results (Batch level, tests, steps and issues &amp;&#160;results). See <MadCap:xref class="link" href="#The">The Test results views</MadCap:xref> below for more about what you can see and do in each view. </p>
        <h3 class="title">The batch list panel</h3>
        <p>The batches in the list are ordered time-wise, with the most recently run test first. Since the batch list can be very long, it is updated only when you scroll further down the list. </p>
        <div>
            Above the batch list is a toolbar that allows you to:
            <ul class="table-list"><li><span class="table-list-item-name"> <img src="../images/tm-test-results-batch-select-checkbox.png" class="inline-img" /> </span> Select / deselect all visible batches (after any filtering).           </li><li><span class="table-list-item-name"> <img src="../images/tm-test-results-batch-delete-button.png" class="inline-img" /></span> Delete the selected batches. See <MadCap:xref class="link" href="../../working-with-test-batches/how-to-delete-batches.htm">How to delete batches</MadCap:xref>.</li><li><span class="table-list-item-name"> <img src="../images/tm-test-results-batch-update-button.png" /> </span> Update the batch list. See <MadCap:xref class="link" href="#Updating">Updating the page</MadCap:xref> below.        </li><li><span class="table-list-item-name"> <img src="../images/tm-test-results-batch-filter-button.png" /> </span> Filter the batch list. See  <MadCap:xref class="link" href="../../working-with-test-batches/how-to-filter-and-search-batches.htm">How to filter and search batches</MadCap:xref>.          </li></ul></div>
        <p>Each entry in the batch list displays the batch name, the date and time the batch started running and a batch status (<span class="app-item">Running</span>, <span class="app-item">Passed</span>, <span class="app-item">Failed </span>- see <MadCap:xref class="link" href="../../working-with-test-batches/understanding-the-batch-status.htm">Understanding the batch status</MadCap:xref>). There is also an indication if you have started resolving the tests but have not yet saved the results and a checkbox that is used to select the batch for deletion.</p>
        <p>When you click a batch in the list, it becomes the <span class="app-item">current batch </span>and information about that batch will be displayed in the main panel. </p>
        <h3 class="title">Current batch summary panel</h3>
        <p>At the top of the main panel there is a panel that provides information about the currently selected batch:</p>
        <p><a data-lightbox="page-test-result-summary-panel" href="../images/page-test-result-summary-panel.png"><img class="block-image" src="../images/page-test-result-summary-panel.png" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>The information displayed includes the name of the current batch, when the first test in the batch started, how long it took to run and how many tests there are in the batch. This is followed by a breakdown of the numbers of tests in different states : unresolved, aborted, failed, new, running, passed, or have issues. Only values that are non-zero are  displayed. The current batch status (Passed, Failed and so on)&#160;and save state are also displayed here - See <MadCap:xref class="link" href="../../working-with-test-batches/test-batch-status-values.htm">Test and Batch Status</MadCap:xref> more details.</p>
        <p>You can rename the current batch by hovering over its name, clicking on it and typing in a new name  - see <MadCap:xref class="link" href="../../working-with-test-batches/how-to-rename-a-batch.htm">How to rename a batch</MadCap:xref> for more details. </p>
        <h3 class="title">Saving changes to the baseline</h3>
        <p>The save changes to baseline button will "pulse" when you have made changes and have not yet saved them to the baseline.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../images/tm-page-test-results-save-button.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Click on the button to save all the tests. If you don't want to update the baselines of all the tests (since this will immediately impact tests when they next run), then  in <span class="app-page">test details</span> view, select <span class="app-item">Save selected test to baseline</span> in the sub-menu opened when you hover over this button.</p>
        <h3 class="title"><a name="Updating"></a>Updating the page</h3>
        <p>Since tests can be running in the background, the information on this page may not be up-to-date. Both the batch toolbar and the test toolbar have a <span class="inline-img"><img src="../images/update-test-list.png" /></span> button. If these indicators rotate, then this means that more information is available on the server. Click on the button and the panel associated with that button will be updated. </p>
        <h2 class="title">Views on the test results</h2>
        <p>The current batch toolbar contains buttons that allow you to select the current view:</p>
        <p><a data-lightbox="tm-page-test-results-view-selector-buttons" href="../images/tm-page-test-results-view-selector-buttons.png"><img class="block-image" src="../images/tm-page-test-results-view-selector-buttons.png" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>The other buttons in the toolbar view toolbar always contains the same buttons, but some of the operations are only enabled in some of the views, others behave slightly differently in each view. The buttons are described in the view documentation.</p>
        <h3 class="title"><a name="The"></a>The test results views</h3>
        <div>What you actually see in the main panel depends on your current view selected in the <span class="app-item">view selector</span>, there are four different views of the test results: 
				<dl><dt><img src="../../../Resources2/Images/test-manager-screenshots/tm-view-batch-summary.png" class="inline-img" /> <span class="app-page"><MadCap:xref MadCap:conditions="General.ToDo" href="../../../2_ToDo/_tm-test-results-batch-summary-view.htm">Batch summary view</MadCap:xref><MadCap:xref href="javascript:void(0)">Batch summary view</MadCap:xref></span></dt><dd>This view provides you with a high level view of the results of the test runs, and the progress in processing these results, This view displays  graphical summaries of key test attributes and states. For example, you can see the percentage of tests that have mismatches, the percentage of the steps that have been resolved, what browsers and operating systems the tests ran on and more. </dd><dt><img src="../../../Resources2/Images/test-manager-screenshots/tm-view-test-details.png" class="inline-img" />&#160;<span class="app-page"><MadCap:xref MadCap:conditions="General.ToDo" href="../../../2_ToDo/_tm-test-results-test-details-view.htm">Batch details view</MadCap:xref><MadCap:xref href="javascript:void(0)">Batch details view</MadCap:xref></span></dt><dd>
				This view  displays a list of all the tests in the batch along with key information such as the test status and  execution environment.
You can sort, group and filter the tests by various criteria. You can select a subset of the tests and do operations on them such as resolving all the steps,  deleting the test or assigning them to a team member. You can expand a test to see thumbnail images of all the steps along with the test result for that step. </dd><dt><img src="../../../Resources2/Images/test-manager-screenshots/tm-view-batch-steps.png" class="inline-img" />&#160;
<span class="app-page"><MadCap:xref MadCap:conditions="General.ToDo" href="../../../2_ToDo/_tm-test-results-batch-steps-view.htm">Batch Steps view</MadCap:xref><MadCap:xref href="javascript:void(0)">Batch Steps view</MadCap:xref></span></dt><dd> In this view, you can see all the steps in the batch, irrespective of which test they were captured in. You can filter and group the steps using various criteria, and take actions such as resolving all the steps in one click.</dd><dt> <img src="../../../Resources2/Images/test-manager-screenshots/tm-view-remarks-issues.png" class="inline-img" />&#160; <span class="app-page"><MadCap:xref MadCap:conditions="General.ToDo" href="../../../2_ToDo/_tm-test-results-remarks-issues-view.htm">Issues &amp;&#160;remarks view</MadCap:xref><MadCap:xref href="javascript:void(0)">Issues &amp;&#160;remarks view</MadCap:xref></span></dt><dd> In this view, you can see all the steps in the batch that have remarks or issues. </dd></dl></div>
        <h3 class="title">The step thumbnail</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="app-page">test detail</span> and <span class="app-page">step details </span>views, you can see thumbnail images steps. In the <span class="app-page">test details</span> &#160;view, these are initially hidden, and you can see all the steps of any test by clicking on the test. In the <span class="app-item"> step details</span> &#160;view, you can filter and group the steps by various criteria.</p>
        <div>The step thumbnail allows you to :
        <ol class="bulleted-list"><li>See the baseline or checkpoint image</li><li>Highlight the differences found in the image</li><li>Accept or reject individual steps</li><li>Invoke a filter to show all the steps with the same Browser, operating system or viewport.</li><li>Open the test editor or step editor. </li></ol></div>
        <h3 class="title">The test and step editors</h3>
        <p>You can open the test and step editors from any of the views that display a step thumbnail. Clicking on the thumbnail will open up the test editor. You can open the step editor using the step thumbnail menu. The main difference between the test editor and the step editor is that the test editor allows you to navigate through all the steps in a test, whereas the step editor allows you to step through all the steps in a batch, taking into account any filtering and grouping that you have applied to the test results page. </p>
        <div> The step and test editor tools provide you with the following capabilities:
        <ul class="bulleted-list"><li>View larger images of the checkpoint and baseline images and zoom in on details.</li><li>Highlight the differences between the  checkpoint and baseline images.</li><li>Add remarks and issues to regions in the baseline or checkpoint image.</li><li>Define match level  regions.</li><li>Accept or reject the new image.</li><li>Save the updated baseline.</li></ul></div>
