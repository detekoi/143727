        <p>The 
			
			<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductUI" /> is a browser-based tool that gives you access to your   
			
			visual UI test data and allows you to manage the test results, baselines and other meta-data associated with your tests. 
		
		</p>
        <div>The 
			
			<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductUI" /> provides tools that allow you to:
			
			<ul class="bulleted-list"><li>View the results of your visual UI test runs</li><li>Update baseline images</li><li>Annotate baselines with comments and match level regions</li><li>View and manage application and test names</li><li>View and manage baselines and branches</li><li>View and manage execution environments</li><li>Compare and merge baseline branches</li><li>Manage your account, teams, and users</li></ul></div>
        <h2 class="title">Test manager pages</h2>
        <p>
		The 
			
		<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductUI" /> UI&#160;is divided into a number of pages. Each page supports a different aspect of  your visual UI testing  workflow. In the section below you can read an overview of the functionality provided by each page. Click on the page name to see the full description of that page. 		
			</p>
        <div>The following top-level pages are available:
			
			<dl><dt><span class="app-page"><a href="pages/tm-page-test-results.htm">Test results</a></span></dt><dd> This page displays  test run results and allows you to determine if and where the baseline should be updated. On this page, you can easily see if a mismatch was found even in a large batch of tests, and tests with many steps.  You can view the captured and baseline images, and determine if a baseline image in some step of a particular test should be updated to the image that was captured in the last run or not. Tools are provided that allow you to  annotate the baseline steps by adding issues and remarks and to mark regions that should have a special  match sensitivity level. You can assign individual test results to team members to follow up on specific issues.</dd><dt><span class="app-page"><a href="pages/tm-page-apps-and-tests.htm">Apps &amp;&#160;tests</a></span></dt><dd>On this page,  you can  see all the application and test names used in your team's test runs. You can delete or change these names. You can see a list of all the baselines of any application/test pair and can display the history of revisions of any baseline. You can open the test results viewer to see the test results of particular runs. </dd><dt><span class="app-page"><a href="pages/tm-page-branch-baselines.htm">Branch baselines</a></span></dt><dd>
						 This page lists all the baselines of a branch that you choose. 
It allows you to  search for a particular test or step, organize the test and step information in various ways and to see the test meta-data and step images.	 You can delete baselines or copy them to other branches.	 You can see the history of any baseline, compare revisions, and 	open the test results viewer to  a particular run of the baseline. 		</dd><dt><span class="app-page"><a href="pages/tm-page-environments.htm">Environments</a></span></dt><dd><MadCap:snippetText src="pages/page-environments/tm-page-environment-overview.flsnp" /><![CDATA[
					]]></dd><dt><span class="app-page"><a href="pages/tm-page-compare-merge-branches.htm">Compare and merge branches</a></span></dt><dd>This page supports a "branch and then merge" workflow of your baseline. You create a branch by using SDK&#160;commands; then, when you are ready to merge the source branch back into the target branch, this  page allows you to compare the branches and display any differences and conflicts between the source and target branches. You can change the source branch annotations by copying annotation from  a target step, changing existing annotations or adding new annotations. Finally for every difference between the branches you can specify if the target baseline should be updated from  the source branch or not. </dd><dd>When you have resolved all conflicts, you can request that <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> finalize the merge. </dd><dt><span class="app-page">Admin</span></dt><dd>This page provides tools to manage your account, users, and teams. It is only available if you have admin privileges.
				</dd><p>&#160;</p></dl><h2 class="title">Page navigation</h2><p>You can navigate to any of these pages by using the <span class="app-item">page navigator</span> at the top of the browser page. Just click on the navigator and select the page that you want. </p><p><img class="block-image" src="images/page-navigator-open.png" /></p><p>The page navigator always shows the name of the current page. In some cases, these are pages that are not directly accessible from the navigator but are opened in the context of another page. </p><h3 class="title">Standard UI&#160;tools</h3><p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductUI" /> provides various tools that help you sort, group and control the data and images that you see. These tools are available on various pages, and although they don't always provide exactly the same functionality on each page, they do have a common look and feel. You can read an overview of the tools in the article <MadCap:xref class="link" href="pages/tm-ui-overview.htm">Test manager UI overview</MadCap:xref>.</p></div>
