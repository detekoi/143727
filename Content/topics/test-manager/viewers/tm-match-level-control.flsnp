        <p>You can see if a change in the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="EyesTerms.Term14">match level</MadCap:glossaryTerm> would change the outcome of any differences detected in the image using the <span class="app-item">Match </span>button which is found to the left of the zoom buttons. This button initially shows the match level that was used during the test. Clicking on the button and selecting a different match level will reprocess the images with the selected level and update the display. Note that this has no impact on the match level used for test runs - these depend on the match level set in the SDK and via the match level annotations.</p>
