        <h1 class="title">Step navigator control</h1>
        <p>At the bottom of test and baseline editors there is a playback control that provides tools enables you to move between the steps of a test:</p>
        <p><a data-lightbox="navigate-timeline-panel" href="resources/navigate-timeline-panel.png"><img class="block-image" src="resources/navigate-timeline-panel.png" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>The control displays a timeline of all the steps in the test or baseline- each rectangle on the timeline corresponds to a step - four in the example above. </p>
        <div>Depending on the type of editor, the steps may be colored:
        <ol class="bulleted-list"><li>If you are displaying the steps of a baseline, then the steps are gray.</li><li>If you are displaying the steps of test results, then the color of the block indicates if the step has passed (green), failed (red) or requires resolution (orange).</li><li>If you are viewing compare baseline results, then red indicates that the steps are different and green indicates that the steps are identical.</li></ol></div>
        <div>The buttons to the left of the timeline allow you to switch the current image display to a different step. There are four buttons that allow you to jump to:
        <ol class="bulleted-list"><li>The previous step with a difference/mismatch (if it is colored, grayed out if there is no previous step)</li><li>The previous step (left arrow on the keyboard)</li><li>The next step (right arrow on the keyboard)</li><li>The next step with a difference/mismatch (if it is colored, grayed out if there is no next step)</li></ol></div>
        <p>The timeline cursor is positioned at the current step. You can drag it along the timeline to move to any step you want. As you drag it, it displays a small thumbnail of the step image at that position, when you release the mouse the main display is updated to show the step where the timeline cursor is currently positioned.</p>
        <p>The playback all steps button automatically starts an animation from the current step onwards, displaying each step for a few seconds. Click the button again to pauses the playback.</p>
