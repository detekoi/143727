        <p>The steps that have differences will be colored orange, those that are the same are colored green. You can use the <span class="app-item">Prev diff</span> <img src="resources/editor-prev-diff.png" class="inline-img" /> and <span class="app-item">Next diff</span> <img src="resources/editor-next-diff.png" class="inline-img" /> buttons to navigate only between the steps that have differences, skipping the steps that match. These buttons will be gray if there are no more differences in that direction. See <MadCap:xref class="link" href="tm-viewer-editor-timeline-control.htm">Test editor timeline control</MadCap:xref> for more details about this tool.</p>
