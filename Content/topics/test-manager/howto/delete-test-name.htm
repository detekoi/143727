        <h1 class="title">Delete test names</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../pages/page-apps-tests/a-visual-test-is-identified-by.flsnp" />  The <span class="app-page">App &amp;&#160;tests</span> page list all of the application names used by your team, and gives a list of tests for each application.</p>
        <p>You can delete a test name from the list of tests of an application on the <span class="app-page">App &amp;&#160;tests</span> page. This <u>does not</u> delete any results or baselines that were previously created using the  test name in this application. </p>
        <div>To delete a test "My test"&#160;in an application "My application":
        <ol><li><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../pages/page-apps-tests/find-app-in-app-and-test-page.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="SnippetParams.appName:My application," /></li><li>Click on the application name, it will become the current application, and the <span class="app-item">test panel </span>will be updated with all the tests of that application.</li><li>There are two ways to delete test names. 
			<ul><li> You can delete a single name by clicking on the <img src="../common/images/vertical-dot-menu.png" class="inline-img"></img> menu, that appears at the far right when you hover over a test row, and then selecting "Delete" from the menu.</li><li>You can delete one or more tests by selecting the checkboxes on the rows that you want to delete and then clicking on the <img src="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-name-delete-button.png" class="inline-img" /> button in the test toolbar. </li></ul></li></ol></div>
        <p>If appropriate, you can type text  in the <span class="app-item">Filter tests</span> control, and only tests that contain that text will be displayed. Then select all the visible tests using the <span class="app-item">Toggle selections</span> checkbox. and now you can deleted all these tests using the <img src="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-name-delete-button.png" class="inline-img" /> button. (See <MadCap:xref class="link" href="../pages/tm-page-apps-and-tests.htm#Filter2">Filter the list of tests</MadCap:xref> for more details).</p>
        <p><a data-lightbox="/app-test-select-all-testname" href="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-select-all-testname.png"><img class="block-image" src="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-select-all-testname.png" /></a>
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Notes</h2>
        <p>If you run a test using a test name that has been deleted, then it will be recreated as the original test, and the test name will reappear  on the <span class="app-page">Apps &amp;&#160;tests</span> page. </p>
        <p>Even after you delete a test, you may not use its name as the new name in a rename test operation; if you try to do so you will get an error message.</p>
