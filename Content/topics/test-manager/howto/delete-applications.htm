        <h1 class="title">Deleting  application names</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../pages/page-apps-tests/a-visual-test-is-identified-by.flsnp" /> The <span class="app-page">App &amp;&#160;tests</span> page list all of the application names used by your team, and gives a list of tests for each application.</p>
        <p>You can delete an application name from the list of applications on the <span class="app-page">App &amp;&#160;tests</span> page. This will also delete all the test names associated with that application. It does not, however, delete any results or baselines that were created using the application name in previous runs. </p>
        <p>To delete an application, navigate to the <span class="app-page">App &amp;&#160;tests</span> page and find the application you want to delete in the list of applications in the left pane. If the list is long you can filter the list by typing some text in the <span class="app-item">filter apps</span> control; the system will only display applications whose name contain the text you typed :</p>
        <p><a data-lightbox="app-test-app-filter.png" href="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-app-filter.png"><img class="block-image" src="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-app-filter.png"></img></a>
        </p>
        <p>There are two ways to delete an application. To delete a single application hover over its name in the list, and  select the "Delete" action from the <img src="../common/images/vertical-dot-menu.png" class="inline-img" /> menu that appears to the left of the application name when you hover over that name. </p>
        <p><a data-lightbox="app-test-app-delete-menu" href="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-app-delete-menu.png"><img class="block-image" src="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-app-delete-menu.png"></img></a>
        </p>
        <p>If you want to delete several applications, then select the entries you want to delete using the checkbox on the left of each item, alternatively, you can use the <span class="app-item">Filter apps</span> control to display only apps that have some common text. Then use the <span class="app-item">select all</span> checkbox to select all the visible applications.</p>
        <p><a data-lightbox="app-test-app-toggle-all" href="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-app-toggle-all.png"><img class="block-image" src="../pages/page-apps-tests/resources/app-test-app-toggle-all.png"></img></a>
        </p>
        <p>Once you've selected the application that you want to delete, click the <span class="app-item">delete selected apps</span> icon <img src="../common/images/delete-button.png" />.</p>
        <h2 class="title">Notes</h2>
        <p> If you run a test using an application name that has been deleted, then it will be recreated as the original application, and the application will appear again on the <span class="app-page">Apps &amp;&#160;tests</span> page. Effectively, by running the test with the old name, you have "undeleted" the application. </p>
        <p>Even after you delete an application, you may not use its name as the new name in a rename application operation; if you try to do so you will get an error message.</p>
