        <h1 class="title"><a name="Deleting"></a>Deleting baselines</h1>
        <p>You can delete baselines from either the <span class="app-page">branch baselines </span>page or the <span class="app-page">test baseline</span> page. You may find that the  branch baseline page is more convenient when  you want to delete baselines from multiple tests or multiple applications, whereas the test baselines page is more convenient when you want to delete one or more baselines from the same test.</p>
        <h3 class="title">Navigating to the <span class="app-page">branch baseline</span> page.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the <span class="app-page">Branch baselines</span> page using the <span class="app-item">Page navigator</span>.</li>
            <li>Select the branch with the baseline you want to delete.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="title">Navigating to the <span class="app-page">test baseline</span> page</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../common/navigate-to-test-baselines-page.flsnp" />
        <p>These pages are very similar, the difference is that the <span class="app-page">branch baselines</span> page contains baselines for all the tests in the branch and the <span class="app-page">test baselines </span>page only shows the baselines for the test you previously chose on the <span class="app-page">apps &amp;&#160;test</span> page. In either case, the procedure to delete baselines is the same:</p>
        <ul class="numbered-list">
            <li>Ensure sure you are in baseline-detail view <img src="../pages/page-branch-baselines/resources/button-baseline-details-view.png" class="inline-img" />.
			<ul class="bulleted-list"><li>To delete a single baseline, use the row menu <img src="../pages/page-branch-baselines/resources/baseline-row-menu.png" />  that appears at the end of a baseline row when the cursor is over that row and then select the <span class="app-item">Delete</span> option.</li><li>To delete several baselines, you can select a number of baselines using the checkbox on each row,  or you can use the  filter tool to narrow down the tests by various criteria, and then select the checkbox in the toolbar to select all the visible baselines. </li></ul></li>
            <li>Click the <img src="../pages/page-branch-baselines/resources/button-delete-baseline.png" class="inline-img" /> button in the toolbar to delete all the selected baselines. </li>
            <li>Whichever method you use,  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will display a confirmation dialog. Select "Confirm" to continue to delete all the baselines or select "Cancel" to abort the delete request.</li>
        </ul>
