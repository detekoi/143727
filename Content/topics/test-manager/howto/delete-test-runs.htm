        <h1>How to delete test runs</h1>
        <p>This article describes how you can delete from the server test results you no longer require . Note that removing a test result does not delete the baseline used or updated by that results. Removing the results does not impact future runs of the test in any way. </p>
        <div>You can delete test results that from two places in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductUI" /><ul class="bulleted-list"><li>On the  <span class="app-page">Test results</span> page, you can delete either an entire <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="EyesTerms.Term7">batch</MadCap:glossaryTerm> &#160;or a subset of the tests of a batch.</li><li>On the <span class="app-page">Last test run</span>, page you can delete test runs for a particular test (application/test name pair) irrespective of when they were run or under which batch or <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="EyesTerms.Term8">execution environment</MadCap:glossaryTerm>.</li></ul></div>
        <div>On both pages, the deletion method is identical.
